# QuickView
###### version 1.0.0


## Description
Simple, elegant and modern front-end jQuery plugin which allows users to preview documents online in HTML 5.
It can be easily integrated into any platform (Java, .NET, etc). Simple and flexible configuration makes integration process quite easy and intuitive.

**Note** QuickView doesn't provide any document conversion engine. QuickView is developed to support document conversion engines and is able only to preview already converted documents (documents must be converted into HTML page by page).
To convert documents into proper format use [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](http://www.groupdocs.com/java/document-viewer-library) or [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](http://www.groupdocs.com/dot-net/document-viewer-library).
