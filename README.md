# QuickView
###### version 1.0.2


## Description
QuickView is simple, elegant and modern UI written in JavaScript which allows users to open and view over 50 different document types.
QuickView can be easily integrated into any platform such as Java, .NET, etc (check Java and .NET samples at the bottom of this document).
Simple and flexible configuration makes integration process quite easy and intuitive.

**Note** QuickView doesn't provide any document conversion engine. QuickView is developed to support document conversion engines and is able only to preview already converted documents (documents must be converted into HTML or images page by page).
To convert documents into proper format use [GroupDocs.Viewer for Java](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/java) or [GroupDocs.Viewer for .NET](https://products.groupdocs.com/viewer/net).
